# bank-customer-churn-prediction
A logistic regression model to predict bank customer churn using Bank Customer Churn Dataset from kaggle.

# Overview
This project uses a LogisticRegression Model to predict bank customer churn, it utilizes various features such as customer age, gender, credit score etc to predict the churn among the bank customers. As churn in this dataset is defined as 0 (No churn) and 1 (Churn) so a LogisticRegression model is used to classify customers accordingly. This model has achieved a score of 0.8015
